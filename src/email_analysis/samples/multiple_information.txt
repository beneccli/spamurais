Hi Team,

I wanted to share a few updates and reminders with you:
	1.	Pierre, your password will soon expire. Please make sure to update it before the end of the week to avoid any disruptions.
	2.	Celine is now officially working on the project Arrakis. Please coordinate with her for any updates or questions related to the project.
	3.	The report on RAG for the client needs to be finalized and submitted by Friday. Letâ€™s ensure we meet the deadline.
	4.	Our next team meeting for the retrospective is scheduled for 3 PM in Room 402. Please be on time.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Swarnayanka
